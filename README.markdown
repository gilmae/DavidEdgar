I'm a software engineer, technologist, leader, and human being.
I live in Sydney, Australia.

I currently work as a technical leader and Development Manager for Salmat Digital.
I am looking for new opportunities and am interested in roles in either technical leadership or product leadership. Hey, a (resume)[resume].

I do things.

Like [code](https://github.com/gilmae). And [blog](https://blog.avocadia.net). More often in [short form](https://twitter.com/gilmae). I [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1506188-david).

I have created some things, like this [randomised Mandelbrot plotter](https://twitter.com/randommandelbot) or this [semiotic square generator](https://twitter.com/semioticia).

I will be one of the first eaten when the stars align.
